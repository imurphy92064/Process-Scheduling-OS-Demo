# Process-Scheduling-OS-Demo
This repo contains several programs that demonstrate different scheduling techniques used in some Operating Systems. You can download/look at the source code, or you can download the .exe and run it inside a CLI to see behavior. IMPORTANT when running the program inside the CLI make sure to have the schedule.txt as an option.
Example: "<scheduling program you want to run>.exe schedule.txt"
